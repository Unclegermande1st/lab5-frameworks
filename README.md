 Lab 5 - Frameworks

 Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for Lab 5, where we explored three web development frameworks: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.

Tools Used
Bootstrap, A popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It provided a grid system and pre-designed components for the layout.
Tailwind CSS, A utility-first CSS framework that allowed us to quickly style components using pre-built utility classes.
React, A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We created an interactive React component with state management using `useState()`.

Completed Features
Bootstrap Demo, Created a responsive layout with a navbar and a two-column grid using Bootstrap.
Tailwind Demo, Designed a responsive card layout with an image, headline, and a call-to-action button using Tailwind CSS.
React Demo, Built an interactive component that displays a welcome message and toggles a message on/off using React and `useState()`.
